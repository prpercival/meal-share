# MealShare - Social Meal Prepping Application

## Application Description

MealShare is a social meal prepping platform that connects users in local communities to share the burden and costs of healthy meal preparation. The application addresses common challenges in meal prepping: time constraints, food waste, lack of variety, and high grocery costs.

**Core Concept**: Users prepare family-sized portions of one meal per week and exchange portions with nearby community members. This creates a diverse weekly meal plan while requiring users to cook only once per week.

**Key Features**:
- Location-based user matching within local communities
- Recipe sharing and meal planning coordination
- Dietary preference and restriction filtering
- Meal exchange scheduling and logistics
- Community ratings and trust-building features
- Cost-splitting and nutritional tracking

**Target Users**: Health-conscious individuals and families who want to maintain a diverse, nutritious diet while minimizing time spent cooking and grocery shopping.

## Tech Stack & Development Requirements

### Core Framework
- **React Native with Expo**: Cross-platform mobile development for iOS and Android
- **Expo Router**: File-based routing system for navigation between screens
- **React Context API**: Global state management for user data, theme preferences, and app state

### UI/UX Requirements
- **Theming System**: 
  - Centralized theme configuration with light and dark mode support
  - Consistent color palette, typography, and spacing tokens
  - Theme toggle functionality accessible from user settings
  - System preference detection for automatic theme selection

- **Design Principles**:
  - Material Design 3 or iOS Human Interface Guidelines compliance
  - Consistent iconography using vector icons (Expo Vector Icons)
  - Responsive design for various screen sizes
  - Intuitive gesture controls and animations
  - Loading states and error handling UX patterns

### Development Structure
- **Component Architecture**:
  - Reusable UI components library
  - Screen-specific components organized by feature
  - Custom hooks for shared logic
  - TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience

- **Mock Data Strategy**:
  - JSON files for static mock data (users, recipes, exchanges)
  - Mock API service layer to simulate backend calls
  - Realistic data sets including diverse user profiles and dietary preferences
  - Sample images and content for recipe cards and user avatars

### Key Libraries & Tools
- **UI Components**: React Native Elements or NativeBase for base components
- **Icons**: @expo/vector-icons for consistent iconography
- **Image Handling**: expo-image for optimized image loading and caching
- **Maps**: react-native-maps for location-based features
- **Camera**: expo-camera for meal photo uploads
- **Storage**: AsyncStorage for local data persistence
- **Styling**: StyleSheet with theme variables or styled-components

### Prototype-Specific Considerations
- **Navigation Flow**: Implement tab-based navigation with stack navigators for each main section
- **State Management**: Use Context API to manage user authentication state, theme preferences, and active exchanges
- **Performance**: Implement lazy loading for images and optimize list rendering for community feeds
- **Testing Strategy**: Include component testing setup and accessibility testing tools
- **Development Workflow**: Hot reload enabled, clear file structure, and component documentation
